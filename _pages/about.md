I am a researcher in microbiology at the Research Institute for Gastroenterology and Liver Diseases, with a focus on bioinformatics applications in cancer biology. My work is guided by a deep interest in understanding the hidden connections between our genes, microbiota, and immune and nervous systems, to uncover new insights for health improvement and disease prevention.

My research themes include:

- **Microbiome Analysis and Disease Modeling**: Investigating how gut microbes influence disease, including cancer and liver diseases.
- **Gene Expression Profiling and Computational Biology**: Utilizing bioinformatics techniques to explore molecular mechanisms in gastrointestinal diseases.
- **Microbiome Therapeutics and Drug Delivery**: Developing models for microbiome-based therapies and studying probiotic effects, including projects on *Lactobacillus crispatus*.

I hold a bachelor’s degree from Alzahra University and a master’s degree from Azad Medical University of Tehran. In addition to my lab work, I teach biology, helping students delve into the molecular and cellular complexities of life. My background spans microbiology, molecular biology, and computational biology, allowing me to approach these themes holistically, with an eye toward personalized medicine.

### October 2024 – Exploring the Role of Non-Coding RNA in NAFLD and Lactobacillus Therapy
We’re thrilled to announce the second phase of our project on non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and the therapeutic potential of Lactobacillus strains. This time, we’re using RNA sequencing to dive deeper into non-coding RNAs that may influence NAFLD to identify specific non-coding RNAs that respond to Lactobacillus therapy.

### June 2024 – New Project Launched on Bacterial Toxins and Autophagy!
Exciting news! We’ve assembled a talented team to investigate the impact of bacterial toxins on autophagy. Our project will begin with an in-depth review of current knowledge in the field, setting the stage for future in vivo experiments to explore how these toxins might influence cellular cleanup processes like autophagy.

### February 2024 – Upcoming Publication on Gut Microbiota and Physical Performance!
Our research on the connection between gut microbiota and physical performance is about to make waves! We’re thrilled to share that our findings, soon to be published in Scientific Reports, reveal how specific microbiota compositions could shape athletic performance.

### November 2023 – Investigating Akkermansia muciniphila’s Role in Apoptosis in Intestinal Cells
Our team has been hard at work studying the effects of Akkermansia muciniphila, a key gut bacterium, on apoptosis in Caco-2 cells. This research could have important implications for gut health, as apoptosis (or programmed cell death) is critical in maintaining a healthy gut lining.

### April 2023 – Gut-Brain Axis and Alzheimer’s Disease: New In Vitro Study
Can gut health influence brain health? We’re diving into this question by studying the impact of gut microbiota on Alzheimer’s disease markers. Using an in vitro model, our team is exploring how gut-derived compounds might impact cellular processes involved in neurodegeneration.

Site-wide configuration
------
The main configuration file for the site is in the base directory in [_config.yml](https://github.com/academicpages/armitaem.github.io/main//blob/master/_config.yml), which defines the content in the sidebars and other site-wide features. You will need to replace the default variables with ones about yourself and your site's github repository. The configuration file for the top menu is in [_data/navigation.yml](https://github.com/academicpages/armitaem.github.io/main//blob/master/_data/navigation.yml). For example, if you don't have a portfolio or blog posts, you can remove those items from that navigation.yml file to remove them from the header. 


**Markdown generator**

------
Many people use a git client to create files on their local computer and then push them to GitHub's servers. If you are not familiar with git, you can directly edit these configuration and markdown files directly in the github.com interface. Navigate to a file (like [this one](https://github.com/academicpages/armitaem.github.io/main//blob/master/_talks/2012-03-01-talk-1.md) and click the pencil icon in the top right of the content preview (to the right of the "Raw | Blame | History" buttons). You can delete a file by clicking the trashcan icon to the right of the pencil icon. You can also create new files or upload files by navigating to a directory and clicking the "Create new file" or "Upload files" buttons. 

Example: editing a markdown file for a talk
