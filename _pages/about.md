I am a **researcher in microbiology** at the *Research Institute for Gastroenterology and Liver Diseases*, specializing in **bioinformatics applications in cancer biology**. My work focuses on uncovering connections between our genes, microbiota, and immune and nervous systems to reveal new insights for health improvement and disease prevention.

## ðŸ§¬ Research Themes

### ðŸ¦  Microbiome Analysis and Disease Modeling
- Investigating how gut microbes influence diseases, including **cancer** and **liver diseases**.

### ðŸ’» Gene Expression Profiling and Computational Biology
- Utilizing bioinformatics techniques to explore molecular mechanisms in **gastrointestinal diseases**.

### ðŸ’Š Microbiome Therapeutics and Drug Delivery
- Developing models for microbiome-based therapies and studying **probiotic effects**, particularly on *Lactobacillus crispatus*.



## ðŸŽ“ Education
- Bachelorâ€™s Degree from **Alzahra University**
- Masterâ€™s Degree from **Azad Medical University of Tehran**

In addition to my lab work, I also teach **biology**, helping students explore the molecular and cellular complexities of life. My academic background spans microbiology, molecular biology, and computational biology, enabling me to approach research holistically with a focus on **personalized medicine**.

Site-wide configuration
------
The main configuration file for the site is in the base directory in [_config.yml](https://github.com/academicpages/armitaem.github.io/main//blob/master/_config.yml), which defines the content in the sidebars and other site-wide features. You will need to replace the default variables with ones about yourself and your site's github repository. The configuration file for the top menu is in [_data/navigation.yml](https://github.com/academicpages/armitaem.github.io/main//blob/master/_data/navigation.yml). For example, if you don't have a portfolio or blog posts, you can remove those items from that navigation.yml file to remove them from the header. 


**Markdown generator**

------
Many people use a git client to create files on their local computer and then push them to GitHub's servers. If you are not familiar with git, you can directly edit these configuration and markdown files directly in the github.com interface. Navigate to a file (like [this one](https://github.com/academicpages/armitaem.github.io/main//blob/master/_talks/2012-03-01-talk-1.md) and click the pencil icon in the top right of the content preview (to the right of the "Raw | Blame | History" buttons). You can delete a file by clicking the trashcan icon to the right of the pencil icon. You can also create new files or upload files by navigating to a directory and clicking the "Create new file" or "Upload files" buttons. 

Example: editing a markdown file for a talk
