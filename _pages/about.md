Hello! I’m Armita, and I’m on a mission to uncover the hidden connections between our genes, microbiota, and immune and nervous systems. I earned my bachelor’s degree from Alzahra University and master’s degree from Azad Medical University of Tehran. Currently, I work as a researcher in a microbiology lab, where I focus on gaining a molecular perspective of human diseases. In addition to my research, I also teach biology, sharing my enthusiasm for science and helping students explore the fascinating complexities of life at the cellular and molecular levels.

I’m deeply fascinated by how details at the molecular level influence broader biological systems, offering new insights for health improvement and disease prevention. My background in microbiology, molecular biology, and computational biology allows me to approach these questions with a holistic perspective. Whether I’m investigating how gut microbes impact cancer events, using machine learning to predict health outcomes, or engineering probiotics for therapeutic use, my goal is to drive meaningful insights that could shape the future of personalized medicine.”



My Work and Research
======
My work as a researcher in a microbiology lab at the Research Institute for Gastroenterology and Liver Diseases has immersed me in diverse projects in microbiology, molecular biology, and bioinformatics. Currently, my focus is on bioinformatics applications in cancer biology, with experience that includes clinical microbiology research, where I was part of an anaerobic bacterial research group exploring gastrointestinal diseases, microbiome therapies, and drug delivery modeling.


Through projects like multilocus sequence typing of Clostridioides difficile and studying the protective effects of Lactobacillus crispatus in liver disease models, I’ve developed expertise in microbiome analysis, gene expression profiling, and computational biology techniques. Teaching biology alongside my research allows me to inspire students and share my excitement for uncovering the mysteries of life through both laboratory work and data analysis.

Site-wide configuration
------
The main configuration file for the site is in the base directory in [_config.yml](https://github.com/academicpages/armitaem.github.io/main//blob/master/_config.yml), which defines the content in the sidebars and other site-wide features. You will need to replace the default variables with ones about yourself and your site's github repository. The configuration file for the top menu is in [_data/navigation.yml](https://github.com/academicpages/armitaem.github.io/main//blob/master/_data/navigation.yml). For example, if you don't have a portfolio or blog posts, you can remove those items from that navigation.yml file to remove them from the header. 

News
------
October 2024 – Exploring the Role of Non-Coding RNA in NAFLD and Lactobacillus Therapy
               We’re thrilled to announce the second phase of our project on non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and the therapeutic potential of Lactobacillus strains. This time, we’re using RNA sequencing to dive deeper into non-coding RNAs that may influence NAFLD to identify specific non-coding RNAs that respond to Lactobacillus therapy.

June 2024 – New Project Launched on Bacterial Toxins and Autophagy! 
               Exciting news! We’ve assembled a talented team to investigate the impact of bacterial toxins on autophagy. Our project will begin with an in-depth review of current knowledge in the field, setting the stage for future in vivo experiments to explore how these toxins might influence cellular cleanup processes like autophagy.

February 2024 – Upcoming Publication on Gut Microbiota and Physical Performance!
                Our research on the connection between gut microbiota and physical performance is about to make waves! We’re thrilled to share that our findings, soon to be published in Scientific Reports, reveal how specific microbiota compositions could shape athletic performance.

November 2023 – Investigating Akkermansia muciniphila’s Role in Apoptosis in Intestinal Cells
               Our team has been hard at work studying the effects of Akkermansia muciniphila, a key gut bacterium, on apoptosis in Caco-2 cells. This research could have important implications for gut health, as apoptosis (or programmed cell death) is critical in maintaining a healthy gut lining.
               
April 2023 – Gut-Brain Axis and Alzheimer’s Disease: New In Vitro Study  
                Can gut health influence brain health? We’re diving into this question by studying the impact of gut microbiota on Alzheimer’s disease markers. Using an in vitro model, our team is exploring how gut-derived compounds might impact cellular processes involved in neurodegeneration.


**Markdown generator**

------
Many people use a git client to create files on their local computer and then push them to GitHub's servers. If you are not familiar with git, you can directly edit these configuration and markdown files directly in the github.com interface. Navigate to a file (like [this one](https://github.com/academicpages/armitaem.github.io/main//blob/master/_talks/2012-03-01-talk-1.md) and click the pencil icon in the top right of the content preview (to the right of the "Raw | Blame | History" buttons). You can delete a file by clicking the trashcan icon to the right of the pencil icon. You can also create new files or upload files by navigating to a directory and clicking the "Create new file" or "Upload files" buttons.
